# patatap_clone

Hi Guys,

here is my version of patatap app. 

I didn't hard code any sounds and colors to different keys. 
Instead for every new circle, a new random color is generated with random position.

Secondly on every key press one of predefined sounds is randomly picked and played.

Lastly I'm resetting circles final destination every two seconds, so they end up moving nicely around whole screen. :-)
